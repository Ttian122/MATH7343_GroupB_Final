The project aims to identify the key lifestyle factors that impact personal carbon emissions and developing a predictive model to estimate individual carbon footprints based on these factors.

The project utilizes a synthetic dataset from Kaggle, whichclosely mimics real-world scenarios of individual carbon emissions. 
Then employs a comprehensive data analysis pipeline, including: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Hypothesis Testing, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regularization and Model Evaluation.

We successfully built a predictive model for individual carbon emission and found that travel and transportation factors, personal waste factors, body type and gender are the factors that have the most significant impact on it.

For detailed results and discussions, please refer to the project report.
